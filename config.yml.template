# Poll GitHub configuration
# Set either github_repos (list of owner/repo) or github_org (organization to poll)
# Example to list specific repos:
# github_repos:
#   - ctxzz-ai/repo1
#   - ctxzz-ai/repo2

# Example to poll an entire org (public repos only if your GH_PAT has limited scope):
github_org: ctxzz-ai

# Limit initial backfill: when state.json has no entry for a repo, poll only the last N days
since_days: 7

output_dir: site/content/posts
state_file: state.json
# Set OPENAI_API_KEY and GH_PAT (or GITHUB_TOKEN) as environment variables in GitHub Actions
# Example: GH_PAT should have permission to read the target repos; to push back to this repo it also needs write access

# Hugo site configuration
site_dir: site
theme: ananke
# Update baseURL to your site URL
baseURL: https://ctxzz-ai.github.io/til-blog/
